# Roadmap for Multi-Agent Deep Research System

This issue tracks the planned milestones and features for the project.

## Milestone 1 - Basic Multi-Agent Orchestrator
- [x] Implement `run_parallel_search` to execute multiple searches concurrently.
- [x] Add `multi-search` CLI command.
- [x] Provide unit tests for the orchestrator.

## Milestone 2 - Memory and Planning
- [ ] Add a simple memory layer to store intermediate plans and results.
- [ ] Enable the orchestrator to divide queries into subqueries automatically.

## Milestone 3 - Citation Agent
- [ ] Implement an agent that collects citation snippets from sources.
- [ ] Integrate citation data into aggregated research output.

## Milestone 4 - Frontend Integration
- [ ] Build a minimal Node.js UI to invoke backend research tasks.
- [ ] Display aggregated results and citations in the frontend.

Each milestone builds toward a full-featured multi-agent research system inspired by the blog post's architecture and lessons learned.
